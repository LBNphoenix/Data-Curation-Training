# Becoming a Certified Data Curator, Part 3

## Synopsis

These notebooks correspond to Aaron Enright's Twitch coding session in which he demonstrated scraping JSON and HTML.

The session can be found by using the following link:
[Live coding session](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/158655086)

We took on two scraping projects:
* [NCHS Birth Rates by Age](NCHS_birth_rates_by_age)
* [USCG Light List](USCG_light_list)

We also reviewed some [common errors](PitfallsToAvoid.nb) people make while scraping data into the WDF.

The content found here is meant to be a companion to this coding session, allowing anyone to modify and tinker with some of the content from the movie. .nb files can be opened and modified in either [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/), the [Wolfram Open Cloud](https://www.open.wolframcloud.com/) or the [Wolfram Development Platform](https://www.wolfram.com/development-platform/).
