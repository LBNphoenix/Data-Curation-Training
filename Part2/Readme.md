# Becoming a Certified Data Curator, Part 2

## Synopsis

These notebooks correspond to Aaron Enright's Twitch coding session in which he demonstrated scraping HTML.

[Live coding session](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/153602347)

We took on two scraping projects:
* [1999 Oklahoma Tornado Outbreak](1999_OK_tornado_outbreak)
* [US Census State QuickFacts](us_state_quick_facts)

The content found here is meant to be a companion to this coding session, allowing anyone to modify and tinker with some of the content from the movie. .nb files can be opened and modified in either [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/), the [Wolfram Open Cloud](https://www.open.wolframcloud.com/) or the [Wolfram Development Platform](https://www.wolfram.com/development-platform/).
